  <p>
    I am a National Teachers College BSIT student, 
    <br>
    and StackTrek is where I conduct my internship. 
    The exercises should both test and motivate me to pursue a career in programming. 
    <br>
    By the end of the boot camp, I hope to have fully developed my programming language skills and gained access to a variety of opportunities.
    <br>
    I'm grateful.
